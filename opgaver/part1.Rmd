# Introduction {#sec:intro}

$~$

We consider a financial market, where the uncertainty is summarized by the filltered probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \geq 0}, P)$ carrying a Wiener process $(W(t))_{t \geq 0}$. Here $\Omega$ denotes the state space, $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra representing measurable events, $\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ denotes a filtration, which we may think of as a 
flow of information, and at last $P$ denotes a probability measure. We may think of the probability measure $P$ as the real-world
measure. Our only source of uncertainty originates from the Wiener process and we therefore assume that the filtration is defined by

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_t = \mathcal{F}^W_t \qquad \text{for} \qquad t \geq 0 
(\#eq:filtration)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{F}^W_t$ is the natural filtration of the Wiener process, i.e. 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}^W_t = \sigma \{ W(s) : 0 \leq s \leq t \}
(\#eq:sigma)
\end{equation}

All functions in this project are defined with respect to such a filtered probability space and they are
assumed to be sufficiently well-behaved. By this we mean that they posses the continuity, differentiability,
integrability, etc. needed in the situation at hand.

We assume that the market consists of two assets: a risk-free asset with price proces $B$, and a risky asset with price proces $S$. The dynamics under $P$ are given by

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
dB(t) &= r B(t) dt \\
dS(t) &= \mu S(t) dt + \sigma S(t) dW(t)
\end{split}
(\#eq:p-dynamics)
\end{equation}

where $r, \mu \in \mathbb{R}$  and $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}_{+}$ are constant. We may think of the risk-free asset as a bank account with a short rate of interest $r$, and the risky asset as a stock with drift $\mu$ and volatility $\sigma$. 

A stochastic process with dynamics such as $S$ is called a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and it can be shown that

\begin{equation}
S(t) = S(0) \cdot e^{(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)t + \sigma W(t)}
(\#eq:GBM)
\end{equation}

We assume that the market is free of arbitrage and complete, which implies the existence of a unique equivalent martingale measure, which we denote by $Q$. Furthermore, it follows that the dynamics of the stock price under $Q$ is given by

\begin{equation}
dS(t) = r S(t) dt + \sigma S(t) dW^Q(t)
(\#eq:q-dynamics)
\end{equation}

where $W^Q$ is a Wiener process under $Q$.

Consider a financial derivative with a fixed maturity $T$, which pays the amount $g(S(T))$ at maturity. It then follows from the above assumptions that the arbitrage-free price at time $t$, $\Pi(t)$, of such a financial derivative is given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Pi(t) &= E^Q\left[ e^{-\int_t^T \; r \; du} g(S(T)) \; \big| \; \mathcal{F}_t \right] \\
&= e^{-r (T - t)} E^Q \left[ g(S(T)) \; \big| \; S(t) = s \right]
\end{split}
(\#eq:risk-neutral)
\end{equation}

where $E^Q$ denotes the expectation under the measure $Q$. Equation \@ref(eq:risk-neutral) is often called a *risk-neutral* pricing equation.

# Model Assumptions {#sec:model-assumptions}

$~$

The above all sounds quite fancy. However, it does not contain much value unless we understand what it means. Hence, the main intention of the questions below are to create an intuitive understanding of the above. Furthermore, we wish to asses the meaningfullness of the assumptions in regards to the real world which we attempt to model.

$~$

## Questions: Model Assumptions {-}

$~$

2.1 Give an intuitive interpretation of the above assumptions. For example: what is the intuition behind equation \@ref(eq:filtration), \@ref(eq:sigma) and \@ref(eq:p-dynamics)?

2.2 Discuss the meaningfullness of the assumptions in regards to the real world, which we attempt to model. For example: is it reasonable to assume that the stock price is positive and continuous? Furthermore, explain what we mean by an arbitrage-free and complete market. Are these assumptions reasonable? This could lead to a small discussion on reality versus tractability in mathmatical modelling.    

2.3 What underlying assumptions imply the second equality sign in equation \@ref(eq:risk-neutral)?

2.4 Give an intuitive interpretation of the risk-neutral pricing equation \@ref(eq:risk-neutral). Include an explanation of why arbitrage-free prices are not expectations under the real world measure $P$. Hint: Consider a simple contract with the payoff 100 dkr. or 0 dkr. (today) each outcome with a probability of $50\%$ under $P$. What is the expected payoff under $P$? How much would you pay? It depends on whether you are risk averse, risk neutral or risk loving.  

2.5 In the financial world risk-neutral pricing is the dominating paradigme. Explain why risk-neutral pricing is "smart". Hint: think of market prices as an expression of a collective risk profile (in other words the measure $Q$ is determined by the market).

2.6 Consider the following statements about the arbitrage-free price at time $t$ of some future cash flow

(i) the arbitrage-free price at time $t$ equals the discounted cash flow
(ii) the arbitrage-free price at time $t$ equals the discounted expected cash flow conditioned on the market information at time $t$ under $Q$
(iii) the arbitrage-free price at time $t$ equals the expected discounted cash flow conditioned on the market information at time $t$ under $P$
(iv) the arbitrage-free price at time $t$ equals the expected discounted cash flow conditioned on the market information at time $t$ under $Q$

Under what assumptions are the above statements true/false?


$~$

# Geometric Brownian Motion {#sec:GBM}

$~$

The questions below aim to illustrate some of the tractable results regarding GBMs. Also, we shall attempt to fit the stock price model, given by the second equation in \@ref(eq:p-dynamics), to observed prices $\tilde{S}_{t_0}, \tilde{S}_{t_1},..., \tilde{S}_{t_m}$. We assume that the observations are equidistant, meaning that


$$
t_i - t_{i-1} = \Delta t
$$
for all $i = 1,...m$. In other words we assume that the time interval between all oberservations are equal.

In order estimate the stock price model based on observation we (formally) need to specify a statistical model. By a parameterized statistical model we think of sample space $\mathcal{S}$ and a set of distributions $\mathcal{P}$, where 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P} = \{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta \}
\end{equation}

Here the parameter set $\Theta$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Our stock price model contains the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$.


$~$

## Questions: Geometric Brownian Motion {-}

$~$

3.1 Give a (brief) intuitive explanation of the difference between the probability model $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \geq 0}, P)$ and the statistical model $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{P})$.

3.2 How may we interpret the drift and volatility parameters? For example: how does the sign of the drift and the size of the volatility influence the evolution of the stock price over time?

3.3 Derive equation \@ref(eq:GBM). Hint: Consider the stochactic process $Y(t) = \log(S(t))$ and use It√≥'s formula (see Lemma 1.17 in the book *Tools for Computational Finance*).

3.4 Derive the stock price distribution under $P$. Furthermore, derive the distribution of the log-return $\log(S(t)/S(t-1))$ Hint: use equation \@ref(eq:GBM) and the assumption of equidistant observations.

3.5 Download observed prices for the stock index S&P 100. This can for example be down by using the $\texttt{R}$ package $\texttt{quantmod}$. 

3.6 Perform an analysis, based on the observed prices, which investigates whether or not a GBM model for the stock index price seems to be reasonable. 

3.7 Derive closed-form expressions for the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$, of $\mu$ and $\sigma$. Hint: You may avoid some trivial math by following the points below 
  
  (i) Use the distribution of the log-return found in question 3.4. 
  (ii) Use the parameter transformations $a = (\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2) \Delta t$ and $b = \sigma^2 \Delta t$. 
  (iii) Use the known maximum likelihood estimators for the mean and variance of a Normal distribution to find the MLE $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{b}$.
  (iv) Given $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{b}$ it is straight forward to find $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$. 

3.8 Compute $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$ based on observed prices. Perform a sanity check by estimating the parameters using both numerical and analytical methods (i.e. find $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$ using the analytical solutions from question 3.7 and by optimizing the log-likelihood function numerically). Repeat the estimation process twice: (i) using all observations and (ii) using only observations after year 2010. 

3.9 How do the estimates, $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$, from (i) and (ii) differ from each other? Is this what we would expect based on the observation periods?

3.10 Derive closed-form expressions for the variance of $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$. Should we be worried about the variance of $\mu$ in respect to (i) the prediction of future stock prices? (ii) risk-neutral pricing of financial derivatives, which depend on the stock price?

# Monte Carlo Simulation

$~$

In this section the goal is to become familiar with the idea of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. To my knowledge there is no formal definition of MC simulation, but the generel idea can be described loosely as follows:

*Assume that we wish to estimate the expectation of some stochastic variable $X$. We may do so by simulating, say $n$, i.i.d samples of $X$ and then set the MC estimator equal to the sample mean.* 

In mathematical finance we are often interested in cases where $X$ is a function of the stock price, $S$. Let $\tilde{S_i} = (\tilde{S}_{1, i}, ..., \tilde{S}_{m, i})$ denote a simulated path of the stock price at time points $t_1, ..., t_m = T$, given an initial stock price $S_0$. We assume that the time points are equidistant such that $t_1 = \Delta t, t_2 = 2\Delta t,..., m\Delta t = T$. According to the above desription of MC simulation, the MC estimator $\hat{\theta}$ for the expectation of $X$ may be found by 

i) Simulating $n$ independent paths $\tilde{S_1}, ..., \tilde{S_n}$. 
ii) For each path compute $\hat{\theta}_i = X(\tilde{S_i} | S_0)$.
iii) Finally calculate the MC estimator $\hat{\theta}$ by

\begin{equation}
\hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \hat{\theta}_i
(\#eq:MC)
\end{equation}

Below we present pseudo-code for three simulation methods (A, B and C) of a GBM. We shall examine these methods in the questions below.

**Method A**

$\hat{S}_0$ = 100

for i $\in$ $(1, ..., n)$
\begin{aligned}
Z &= \mathtt{rnorm}(1, 0, 1) \\
\Delta S &= \mu \hat{S}_{i-1} \Delta t + \hat{S}_{i-1} \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}Z \\
\hat{S}_i &= \hat{S}_{i-1} + \Delta S,
\end{aligned}

**Method B**

$\hat{S}_0$ = 100

for i $\in$ $(1, ..., n)$
\begin{aligned}
Z &= \mathtt{rnorm}(1, 0, 1) \\
\hat{S}_t &= \hat{S}_{i-1} \exp((\mu - 0.5 \sigma ^ 2) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}Z),
\end{aligned}


**Metode C**

$\hat{S}_0$ = 100

for i $\in$ $(1, ..., n)$
\begin{aligned}
Z &= \mathtt{rnorm}(1, 0, 1) \\
\hat{S}_i &= \hat{S}_0 \exp((\mu - 0.5 \sigma ^ 2) t_i + \sigma \sqrt{t} Z),
\end{aligned}

## Questions: Monte Carlo Simulation  {-}

$~$

4.1 Explain why Monte Carlo simulation is a useful tool in mathematical finance. Hint: how do we represent arbitrage-free prices?

4.2 Describe what we mean by the terms sampling error and discretization error.

4.3 Argue that the following is true for the MC estimator given by equation \@ref(eq:MC) where $n$ is the number of simulated paths:
  
  i) the variance of the MC estimator is approximately proportional til $n^{-1}$, 
  ii) the error of the MC estimator is approximately proportional to $n^{-1/2}$

4.4 Are the methods (A and B) correct or wrong? Explain. Compare the two methods using $\Delta t = 1$, $\Delta t = \frac{1}{10}$ and $\Delta t = \frac{1}{100}$. Explain what you see. 

4.5 Is method C correct or wrong? Explain.

4.6 Let $S(0) = 100, \mu = 0.03, \sigma = 0.1$. Write $\mathtt{R}$ code, which simulates and plots 10 realizations of $S$ under $P$. Is it possible for a simulation path to become negative? If so is that then consistent with our model assumptions and with observed stock prices? 

4.7 Show, using simulations, that the MLEs of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ from section \@ref(sec:GBM) seem to be asymptotic normally distributed. Hint: assume that $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$ are the "true" parameter values and use them in your simulation scheme.  

4.8 Variance reduction techniques: why are we interested in variance reduction in respect to MC simulation? Describe the intuition behind the variance reduction methods antithetic variates and control variates.

4.9 Recreate figure 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 in the book *Tools for Computational Finance*.
